### R Overview of the Month

#### Automate scripts with R

This month Luke will showcase the usage of the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/taskscheduleR/versions/1.8">taskscheduleR</a> package for automating the running of your scripts on a schedule. This is useful is you find yourself gathering data from a source that updates frequently. Then we will go into our community questions.

# UQ RUG Details

 
## This HedgeDoc


You can **edit this document** by clicking the pencil :pencil2: in the top right corner.

You can then **add code** to the document by fencing the block with triple-backticks, like so:

```r
my_vector <- c(1, 5, 2)
```
    
## Code of Conduct

To make our events enjoyable, safe and welcoming, we have a Code of Conduct: https://gitlab.com/stragu/uqrug/blob/master/Code_of_Conduct.md

## Feedback

We have a feedback form: https://frama.link/uqrugfeedback

## Twitter

Follow our news on https://twitter.com/UQ_RUG

## Chat room

We have a **chat room** on UQ's Element server, which you can simply join with your UQ credentials. It allows us to keep the discussion going even outside of meetups, and is also more comfortable than the Zoom chat (especially to share code):

1. Go to https://chat.uq.edu.au
2. Log in with you UQ credentials
3. Click the "hash/magnifying glass" icon to explore rooms (next to the search box)
4. Join the "UQRUG" chat room
 

## General resources

This is our shortlist of useful resources, not specific to one single meetup, but good to have handy:

* Weekly R news: https://rweekly.org/
* Documentation, run R code online: https://rdrr.io
* R Community Flashcards: https://tinyurl.com/Rcommunityslides
* Online courses with LinkedIn Learning (log in [with UQ credentials](https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/training/linkedin-learning-online-courses)): https://au.linkedin.com/learning/
* *Debugging in R* Presentation: https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/object-of-type-closure-is-not-subsettable/
    * Don't freak out about the title. Its one of the most incomprehensible error messages that R will spit out and hence the title for the talk. Some good tips on how to approach code that doesn't do what you think its supposed to.
